# Storemanager
This project is a simple Store Manager Frontend built with React, consisting of three main pages: Home, Inventory, and Cart. The Home page displays products with their details, the Inventory page helps manage product information like stock and tags, and the Cart page shows the items added by the user. It showcases the use of React components, context, and state management to build a basic e-commerce interface.
